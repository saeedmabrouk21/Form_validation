# Form_validation
I used HTML and CSS to implement a basic sign-up form, utilizing the DOM and Regex in JavaScript. 
The DOM helped me add messages to the user indicating whether the validation process was successful or not. 
Regex assisted me in string manipulation for specific patterns in different cases such as username, password, email, and ID.
